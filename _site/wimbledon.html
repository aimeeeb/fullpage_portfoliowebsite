                <p>The Championships: Wimbledon is a prestigious tennis competition in London.
Attendees and competitors come from all around the world. Because of this, Wimbledon
will be needing maps and wayfinding icons, in addition to rebranding with a new icon.
For individuals arriving at Heathrow airport, the goal is to create a map showing how
to get to Wimbledon through two different forms of transportation: car and public
transportation. The visitors will also need a campus map, showing them how to get from
parking lots or public transportation, to event locations.</p>

<h4 id="solution">Solution</h4>

<p><img src="/assets/img/wimbledon_design.png" alt="" /></p>

<p>The Wimbledon logo celebrates important aspects about The
Championships. It includes a green tennis court for the club’s
unique grass courts, the union jack for its location in the United
Kingdom, and the color purple, a color associated with royalty
throughout history, for its royal patronage.</p>

<p>The icons imitate the motion and shape of the logo. The human
figures for the event icons are slanted to feel as if they are
running through the court. The icons for transportation bleed
out of the box to feel as if the vehicle is coming into frame. To
differentiate between ladies and gentlemen, inspiration was
taken from universally understood bathroom icons. For those the
men have broader shoulders and the women have dresses, this
design abstracts these shapes with triangles.</p>

<p>The maps are designed to be highly simplified. Instead of
showing the true geography of the location, the paths are just
straight lines with 45°/90° turns. For the large map, the directions
for the road way only vaguely follow the true shape of the
freeways. This was designed with the assumption that drivers
don’t necessarily notice curves in the road, instead they just
need to know if they are turning right or left or continuing on the
same road. The railways are just lines, based on the assumption
that riders only need to know their stop. For the small map, the
intention was the get visitors from parking or Southfield’s Station
to events, so these are the only thing depicted on the map. The
streets bordering All England Club are darker than the rest since
these will lead people to the location, however side streets are
included for anyone approaching from a different direction</p>
