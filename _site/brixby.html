                <p>Chapman University offers a summer travel course to London called Sustainable Design. The Summer 2019 project involved the development of a new city in Bedford Brickworks, led by Cloud Wing UK and Buro Happold Engineering.</p>

<h4 id="challenge">challenge</h4>

<p>The new development is intended to be a “city of the future.” Cloud Wing UK was interested in learning more about what the younger generation sought out for their future homes and work spaces. Along with researching these ideas, the project involved the creation of presentations to share them. This research led to concepts for a name and brand for the city of the next generation.</p>

<h4 id="solution">solution</h4>

<p><strong>research.</strong> In developing information about a “city of the future” we did extensive research on younger generations and what they’re looking for. This audience included millennials and generation Z. As a team, we searched for day relating to what younger generations look for in their workspace, their future home, and what worries them about the future. This included surveying our class, who were all ages 19-21, putting us in the same age group as the target audience. We also interviewed three young adults living in London to see what would lead native Londoners to move out to a new development. Our findings showed an active group interested in helping the world socially and environmentally who utilized technology but had a growing distrust of it. With our conclusions we created a list of things that would make our generation move to a city like this.</p>

<p><strong>branding.</strong> Based on the ideologies of Buro Happold, Cloud Wing UK, and the plans for development, we defined them into a single vision. We named it the “Elements of New Urban Living” and this acted as our brand for the entire project. The elements were Nature &amp; Wellbeing, Community &amp; Integration, Culture &amp; Creation, Education &amp; Employment, Mobility &amp; Connectivity, and represented the 5 things that would need to be included in this city to be successful.</p>

<p><strong>naming.</strong> To begin branding, we brainstormed as a team to create a list of over 350 names. These names were founded in the history and nature of the area, inspired by naming conventions of the United Kingdom, and many were given a contemporary twist. Our names were brought down to 15 split into 3 categories: Natural, Historical, and Aspirational. Our client chose their top names for each category and we began developing logos for Wilden, Wythe, and Brixby.</p>

<p><strong>identity.</strong> Our logos all looked towards elements in our brand. Even though each name came from a distinctive category, we explored ways to represent history, nature, and aspirations in each design. Ultimately, the client preferred the name Brixby and we moved forward, developing four logo concepts for Brixby that captured the character for this new development.</p>
