                <p>Milk Shake It Up is a great hangout that takes the feeling of a classic ice cream parlor
and focuses on milkshakes. Customers can choose from a variety of flavors, including
unique seasonal flavors, and any toppings they want. This up-and-coming eatery needs
a brand to capture the fun of drinking a milkshake here. This identity will include a logo,
color palette, and overall feel that will connect the future interior design of the store,
the menu, and the store’s website.</p>

<h5 id="audience">Audience</h5>

<p>The main target audience of Milk Shake It Up™ are teenagers. Based on the assumption that that age group is always looking for a place to hang out away from home and school, Milk Shake It Up can offer the perfect retreat. Teenager girls especially may be attracted to the cute style of the eatery. Based on this audience’s continuous exposure to technology, the store will greatly benefit from an online presence or a mobile app.</p>

<h5 id="solution">Solution</h5>

<p><img src="/assets/img/milkshake_design.png" alt="" /></p>

<p>The main color of the brand is a pink to represent the cute personality of Milk Shake It Up™. The specific shade of pink is darker rather than a bright or pastel one to help with readability. It is meant to reflect strawberry ice cream, a very popular flavor
of ice cream and milkshake, while still being readable as text. The accent color is a bright mint, like mint chocolate chip ice cream,
which pops from it’s contrast with the dark pink. Being a brighter color, it is a more joyful color and, because it is pastel, it intends to attract younger audiences.</p>

<p>The font for “MILK” and “IT UP” is a short, rounded serif font to
appear friendlier and cuter . The thickness of the glyphs suggests
the texture of the drinks. The font for “SHAKE,” on the other hand,
is more fun. It is shaken up to give the impression of dancing and
characterizes the mixing of the milkshakes.</p>

<p>The menu is a small size, 5”x7”, since it will mainly be held in
line and the company expects to gain regulars, who won’t even
need to check the menu. For people who have never been to
the restaurant before, it includes a short 3-step list on how
to order and the changeable seasonal drink attracts the new
customer to the more unique aspects of the restaurant’s items.
The toppings offered at the restaurant are not on the menu since
the customers will be choosing those themselves but they are
listed on the company’s website for anyone who wants to plan
their drink before going to the store. It utilize graphics of whipped
cream and milkshakes because any items in kawaii culture are
drawn. It is also meant to remind the viewer that the place is
a milkshake and toppings place, since the logo itself doesn’t
include references to milkshakes. Overall, it is meant to be easy
to handle and simple for new customers to understand.</p>
