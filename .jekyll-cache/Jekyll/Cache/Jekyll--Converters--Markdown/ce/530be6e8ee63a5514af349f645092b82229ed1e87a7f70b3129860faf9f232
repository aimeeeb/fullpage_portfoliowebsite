I"°<p>First American Home Loans is a California-based company that offers services for home
owners such as mortgage refinancing. Currently, their online website serves to provide
more information about the services offered by the company and encourages viewers
to get in contact with an agent. Because of their work in finances, the company needed
to be represented as trustworthy. The website design and content needed to encourage
this view as well as relate to the target audience.</p>

<h4 id="solution">Solution</h4>

<p>A persona was created to represent the audience and influence
the direction of the design, which is intended to create a more
emotional connection with viewers. The persona is a old, retired
couple looking for a way to feel comfortable in their retirement.
With this is mind, the imagery in the redesign shifted to mainly
showing elderly people who appear to be relaxing. The text is
also meant to be larger, to accommodate for visual impairments.</p>

<p>To make the goal of the website clear, the home page has
immediate calls to action. ‚ÄúGet Started‚Äù leads to a form to sign
up for a mailing list and is made to stand out on the navigation
bar as well as the first load. Orange, pulled from the company‚Äôs
branding, is used as an accent color to draw attention towards
items of interest, such as buttons.</p>

<p>The main goal of the website is to provide the customer with
trust in First American Home Loans. This is why the first section
in the scroll after the call to action is a ‚ÄúWho are we‚Äù section.
The company immediately introduces themselves and the
section encourages users to navigate to the ‚ÄúAbout Us‚Äù section
to learn more. In addition, photography is a main visual element.
Photos often feel genuine and trustworthy, especially to an older
audience. It makes it clear that real people are working at First
American Home Loans and real people are reaching out to the
company for their financial needs. This is also achieved with
the addition of testimonials, which will feature images of real
customers and real quotes. Overall, this new design is meant to
humanize the company and communicate to customers that this
is a genuine, trustworthy service.</p>
