I"J	<p>Chapman University offers a summer travel course to London called Sustainable Design. The Summer 2019 project involved the development of a new city in Bedford Brickworks, led by Cloud Wing UK and Buro Happold Engineering.</p>

<h4 id="challenge">challenge</h4>

<p>The new development is intended to be a “city of the future.” Cloud Wing UK was interested in learning more about what the younger generation sought out for their future homes and work spaces. Along with researching these ideas, the project involved the creation of presentations to share them. This research led to concepts for a name and brand for the city of the next generation.</p>

<p><strong>logo + brand.</strong> Omnia is branded to be an amalgamation of a variety of different apps. It is powerful enough to be the only app that a person will need. This is represented with the logo mark of the infinity symbol. A person can spend an endless amount of time on the app and the platforms included in the app feels like an infinite amount. The colors of the Omnia brand are kept to black and white, pushing it into the background so that focus is kept on the brands of the social media.</p>

<p><strong>user interface.</strong> The design of posts on the app is intended to keep a uniform look while also making it very clear where a post is from. Each social media platform has its unique brand color, which is included on the bottom of posts or in a stroke around profile pictures to make them all recognizable at a glance. The logo of each platform is also included in a similar style to Omnia’s identity, allowing for clear identification if colors are obscured on a phone or someone struggles with color blindess.</p>

<p><strong>user experience.</strong> The way the posts are laid out on the home screen is inspired by Pinterest. Users follow hundreds of different accounts on social media and this view allows them to see many posts at once and casually look for the posts that catch their interest. If they only want to browse certain social media posts, there is a filter to allow them to remove any platforms from their feed. If a user wants to browse each post more closely, they can tap on a post and it will fill the screen. Then, similar to Snapchat, if they tap or swipe one side of the screen it will navigate to the next post in their feed.</p>
