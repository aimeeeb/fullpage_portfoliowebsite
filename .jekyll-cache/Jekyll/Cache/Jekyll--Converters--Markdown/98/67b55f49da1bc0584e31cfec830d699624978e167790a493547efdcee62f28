<p>I am a designer born and raised in Honolulu, HI. Currently, I am attending classes at Chapman University in Orange, California for two degrees: <strong>BFA in Graphic Design</strong> and <strong>BS in Computer Information Systems</strong>. I have loved art since I was a child but UI/UX design is where I truly found a way to express my passion for problem solving and my curiosity about technology.</p>
