I"#<p>Chapman University offers a summer travel course to London called Sustainable Design. The Summer 2019 project involved the development of a new city in Bedford Brickworks, led by Cloud Wing UK and Buro Happold Engineering.</p>

<p>The new development is intended to be a “city of the future.” Cloud Wing UK was interested in learning more about what the younger generation sought out for their future homes and work spaces. Along with researching these ideas, the project involved the creation of presentations to share them. This research led to concepts for a name and brand for the city of the next generation.</p>

<p><strong>research.</strong> In developing information about a “city of the future” we did extensive research on younger generations and what they’re looking for. This audience included millenials and generation Z.</p>

<p><strong>naming.</strong> To begin branding, we brainstormed as a team to create a list of over 350 names. These names were founded in the history and nature of the area, inspired by naming conventions of the United Kingdom, and many were given a contemporary twist.</p>

<p><strong>branding.</strong> The way the posts are laid out on the home screen is inspired by Pinterest. Users follow hundreds of different accounts on social media and this view allows them to see many posts at once and casually look for the posts that catch their interest. If they only want to browse certain social media posts, there is a filter to allow them to remove any platforms from their feed. If a user wants to browse each post more closely, they can tap on a post and it will fill the screen. Then, similar to Snapchat, if they tap or swipe one side of the screen it will navigate to the next post in their feed.</p>
