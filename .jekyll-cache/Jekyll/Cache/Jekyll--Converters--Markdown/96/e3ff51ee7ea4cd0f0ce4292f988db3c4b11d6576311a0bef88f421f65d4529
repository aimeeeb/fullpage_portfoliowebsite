I"U<p>Omnia is a social media aggregate app. It connects multiple platforms into a single
interface. Currently, there are social media manager apps that allow you to manage
posting to multiple accounts but Omnia does so much more. It has Facebook, Instagram,
Pinterest, Twitter, and Snapchat and allows users to post, view other’s posts, watch
stories, and use a chat.</p>

<h4 id="solution">Solution</h4>

<p>The app focuses on combining the variety of posts and chats
from all the media into a single style. You can scroll through and
see an overview of all the posts on a feed inspired by Pinterest.
Another option is to open the posts and scroll through them in
the same way you would navigate through stories on Snapchat.
For the chat, you can receive chats from Omnia, Facebook
Messenger, Instagram, Twitter, and Snapchat with differences
only being indicated by the UI of the sender’s profile pictures.
The post feature allows the user to only post text, which would
work for Twitter and Facebook, or to add media, which would
work well with Instagram and Snapchat as well. Omnia is truly
an aggregate app with the only option of separating each social
media platform being a simple filter in the top right.</p>

<p>Because the concept of the app connects multiple things
together, the infinity symbol was used to give an idea of
interconnectivity. In addition, the logo is a play on the idea
of scrolling infinitely since so many posts are placed on a
single feed and the user never has to leave the app. The
strange shape of the symbol allows it to work as the “O” in
the app’s name.</p>

<p>The branding of the app is purely black and white so that
the branding of the app doesn’t fight with the colors of the
other social media. In addition, Omnia is not necessarily
meant to be a platform in itself, just a place to hold the rest
of your social media.</p>
