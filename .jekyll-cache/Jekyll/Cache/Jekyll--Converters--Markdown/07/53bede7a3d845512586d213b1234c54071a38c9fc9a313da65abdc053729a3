I"Å<p>Every year, Chapman University design students create posters to commemorate the achievements of the university.

<p>The 2020 commemorative poster celebrates two of the new apartment buildings for student living, which had just been completed. These buildings allow students to live in a community with their peers, experiencing a greater sense of safety and collaboration. These buildings represent the growth of Chapmanâ€™s student population and the possibility for further growth to the campus.</p>
