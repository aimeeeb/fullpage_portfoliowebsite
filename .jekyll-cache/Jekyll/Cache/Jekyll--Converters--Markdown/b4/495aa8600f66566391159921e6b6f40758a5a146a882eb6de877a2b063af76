<p>My name is Aimee and I am a designer based in Honolulu, HI. I consider myself a problem solver and get excited about designing products that help others. I have a BFA in Graphic Design and a BS in Computer Information Systems and use my interdisciplinary knowledge to create efficiently.</p>

<p>Mainly, I work as a UI/UX designer but I also design logos, marketing material, and illustrate. I spend most of my free time drawing or playing video games, which serve as a huge inspiration to me to make things that engage people. I am open to consulting on projects, don’t hesitate to <a href="/contact">contact me</a>.</p>

<p>That’s a little bit about me, read on to learn about my design process.</p>

<p>As someone who likes to plan and organize, I find my design process is a lot like scheduling my day or cleaning my house. The first step is to assess the situation. This means looking at everything that is there and making sure we really understand what needs to be done. I try to gather all available information about the project, the client, the audience, and more through client meetings and in-depth research. Then the project can really get started.</p>
