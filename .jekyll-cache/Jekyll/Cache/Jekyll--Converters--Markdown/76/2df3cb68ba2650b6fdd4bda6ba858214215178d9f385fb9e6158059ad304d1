<p>Up &amp; Up is one of largest in-house brands of any store. It is a brand under Target
corporation that contains approximately 800 different products, including colored
pencils. Currently, the art supplies are similar to simpler competitors, such as Crayola,
that offer a set of a variety of colors. With this design, the brand is transitioning to
connect to fine art brands, such as Prismacolor, by offer a set of 6 different eight-color
palettes. Each box and set is distinct while still connecting together as a cohesive brand.</p>

<p>Up &amp; Up colored pencils are marketed towards children. More
specifically, the packaging intends to convince parents, who
represent the majority of shoppers at Target, that this product is
a great gift for their child. Children are more attracted to brighter
colors because their eyes are still developing so the series utilizes
highly saturated primary and secondary colors. This intends to
catch the eye of children exploring the store or convince parents
that their child will love the pencils as much as they love other
brightly-colored products, such as toys or playgrounds.</p>

<p><strong>packaging.</strong> Up &amp; Up colored pencils are marketed towards children. More
specifically, the packaging should attract parents, who
represent the majority of shoppers at Target. The colors used for the sets use bright palettes, which catch the attention of children, and are similar to colors found in other things that children enjoy such as toys or playgrounds. It was also important to keep a high level of contrast between the different boxes so each set
seemed unique. The colors were also especially meant to represent the pencils in each set. For example, ‚ÄúArt &amp; School‚Äù uses yellow
which relates to the #2 pencil, school buses, and other products that have connotations of elementary school.</p>

<p>The colors chosen were mainly picked to match the colored
pencils inside of the packages.  The green is for a set of green colors and the
blue for a set of blue colors. For the pastel set, pastel colors
include baby blues and light yellows but when searching pastel
colors the first colors to appear are always pinks and lavenders.
A mix of pink and lavender seemed to more wholly represent
the contents. For the ‚ÄúSkin &amp; Friends,‚Äù which is a nude set, it was
important to keep the theme of bright colors. If you increase
the brightness and saturation many of the nude color the color
becomes a red or an orange, so red was used for the packaging.
For ‚ÄúShiny &amp; Bright,‚Äù neon colors are mainly used for lights so a
warm color was selected to represent the warmth given off by
light bulbs.</p>
