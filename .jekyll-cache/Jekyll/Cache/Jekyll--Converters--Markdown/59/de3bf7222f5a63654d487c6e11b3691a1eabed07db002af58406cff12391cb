	<p>Benadryl is a popular, over-the-counter medication for allergy relief. Many adults and children rely on this product for going through their daily lives comfortably and need to understand how to use it correctly. Likewise, they need to know the side effects of the drugs.</p>

<h4 id="challenge">challenge</h4>

<p>Considering the needs of Benadryl to communicate information, this is a redesign of the product’s packaging to better communicate to customers. Another aspect of the project is meeting the needs of the user, who may need to carry the product with them throughout the day.</p>

<p><strong>logo + brand.</strong> Omnia is branded to be an amalgamation of a variety of different apps. It is powerful enough to be the only app that a person will need. This is represented with the logo mark of the infinity symbol. A person can spend an endless amount of time on the app and the platforms included in the app feels like an infinite amount. The colors of the Omnia brand are kept to black and white, pushing it into the background so that focus is kept on the brands of the social media.</p>

<p><strong>user interface.</strong> The design of posts on the app is intended to keep a uniform look while also making it very clear where a post is from. Each social media platform has its unique brand color, which is included on the bottom of posts or in a stroke around profile pictures to make them all recognizable at a glance. The logo of each platform is also included in a similar style to Omnia’s identity, allowing for clear identification if colors are obscured on a phone or someone struggles with color blindess.</p>

<p><strong>user experience.</strong> The way the posts are laid out on the home screen is inspired by Pinterest. Users follow hundreds of different accounts on social media and this view allows them to see many posts at once and casually look for the posts that catch their interest. If they only want to browse certain social media posts, there is a filter to allow them to remove any platforms from their feed. If a user wants to browse each post more closely, they can tap on a post and it will fill the screen. Then, similar to Snapchat, if they tap or swipe one side of the screen it will navigate to the next post in their feed.</p>
