I"È<p>Maxwell House is a popular coffee brand that began in 1982 and for years was the
highest selling coffee in the United States. Now, the company ventures into a new type
of coffee with their sub brand, Maxwell Home. This is a high-end brand that produces
organic coffee. Maxwell Home is targeted towards coffee lovers concerned with their
health but the new coffee may be most successful at converting loyal Maxwell House
customers. This means that the brand‚Äôs new, unique logo and packaging should visually
relate to the original Maxwell House brand while also representing the organic coffee.</p>

<p>The Maxwell House brand is most recognizable by its iconic blue
color. This is why the most present color on the packaging is a
blue. In addition, the Maxwell House logo is included on the side
of the packaging. Besides these elements, the rest of the brand is
intended to push into a new market and attract new customers.</p>

<p>The logo‚Äôs simplicity brings in the concept of a high-end brand,
along with the elegance of a circle. The shape and style also
resembles a stamp for a homemade product. Homemade items,
such as ones being sold at a farmer‚Äôs market, are usually organic
and the logo adds that to the idea of the brand.</p>

<p>The overall goal of the brand is to represent Maxwell Home as
an organic coffee. While the majority of natural brands may
represent this idea with the use of the color green, leaves, or
coffee beans, this brand uses a more indirect approach. With the
tag line, ‚ÄúCoffee that grew with the sun,‚Äù the packaging utilizes
the color blue to imagine bright skies stretching above a coffee
field. When people are enjoying nature, maybe by hiking or
playing in a park, the reason they go out is because of blue skies.
The yellow and circle shape of the logo represents the sun and
it is the hero of the packaging, just as the sun is the reason the
organic coffee is able to grow</p>
