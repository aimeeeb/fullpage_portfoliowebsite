I"v<p>Chapman University offers a summer travel course to London called Sustainable Design. The Summer 2019 project involved the development of a new city in Bedford Brickworks, led by Cloud Wing UK and Buro Happold Engineering.</p>

<h4 id="challenge">challenge</h4>

<p>The new development is intended to be a “city of the future.” Cloud Wing UK was interested in learning more about what the younger generation sought out for their future homes and work spaces. Along with researching these ideas, the project involved the creation of presentations to share them. This research led to concepts for a name and brand for the city of the next generation.</p>

<p><strong>research.</strong> In developing information about a “city of the future” we did extensive research on younger generations and what they’re looking for. This audience included millenials and generation Z.</p>

<p><strong>naming.</strong> To begin branding, we brainstormed as a team to create a list of over 350 names. These names were founded in the history and nature of the area, inspired by naming conventions of the United Kingdom, and many were given a contemporary twist.</p>

<p><strong>branding.</strong> Combining our research and design exploration, we created an identity for the city. We explored logos for our top three names and developed ideologies for the new city.</p>
