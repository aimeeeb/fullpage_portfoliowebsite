I"€<p>Benadryl is a popular, over-the-counter medication for allergy relief. Many adults and children rely on this product for going through their daily lives comfortably and need to understand how to use it correctly. Likewise, they need to know the side effects of the drugs.</p>

<h4 id="challenge">challenge</h4>

<p>Considering the needs of Benadryl to communicate information, this is a redesign of the productâ€™s packaging to better communicate to customers. Another aspect of the project is meeting the needs of the user, who may need to carry the product with them throughout the day.</p>

<h4 id="solution">solution</h4>

<p><strong>size.</strong> The packaging is created to be easy to carry. Itâ€™s small size and shape makes itâ€™s thinner than the original box design for Bendaryl and allows it to be slipped anywhere that a wallet can fit. This is especially important for an allergy medicine since symptoms can start at any time without warning.</p>

<p><strong>external.</strong> This product, like any other medicine, has a lot of information. However, only some of the information is needed to make the purchase. The outside has the minimum amount of information needed. It shows the amount of pills, the symptoms needed, and all of the ingredients so customers can check for an allergy.</p>

<p><strong>internal.</strong> Once you open the product, the shape of the packaging creates a sense of pacing. Upon opening, customers see the warnings and the directions for taking the medicine. This forces users to take note of the risks. The directions are depicted using icons. A danger for any medication is overdosing, especially for children.</p>
