Eastern Communication Association (ECA) promotes excellence in research, teaching,
criticism, and communication theory. The association hosts an annual convention, with
a different city and a different theme each year. In 2020 the ECA Conference is happening
in Baltimore where innovation, start-ups, and technology flourish. ECA named their
111th conference “Harboring Innovation” as a play on the convention occurring at Inner
Harbor, a popular Baltimore sightseeing hub. The themes each year are culminated into
a unique name and identity.

#### Solution with Aesthetics

Similar to the name of the convention, “Harboring Innovation,” the logo combines the idea of Inner Harbor with that of Baltimore. Businesses, especially startups, are growing quickly throughout the city and often have a focus in technology. A circuit board celebrates the contributions Baltimore has made to the software and hardware industry. Along with that, circuit boards have many intertwining points that meet and connect and the goal of ECA Conference is to bring people together and promote discussion and connectivity. As the circuit board transitions into being a dock, the icon also connects Baltimore to Inner Harbor, which both are a hub although one is for technology and business and the other is for tourism and boats, respectively.

The boats are an essential part of the icon to make it clear that the shape of the circuit board is a dock. It also intends to further promote the convention’s goal to connect people together. The boats travelling to Inner Harbor could come from anywhere but connect at this one location, just like the vendors and attendees.

The logo can work in black and white as well as in two colors that continue to support the ideas behind it. Green ensures that the circuits clearly look like a circuit boards, which are commonly green, but leans towards turquoise. This, in combination with the dark blue, makes the logo look nautically themed while also keeping a professional appears. The type pairs a heroic font for “INNOVATION” that visually matches the circuit board with a cursive style that looks like it would be the name painted on the side of a ship.
