Everyone is encouraged to celebrate their backgrounds at the American Swedish
Historical Museum, located in South Philadelphia, PA. The displays in the museum
celebrate the culture and history of Sweden, Scandinavia, and Swedish-Americans.
There is a variety of examples of Scandinavian culture including architecture, furniture,
design, and more. 

#### Target Audience

The American Swedish Historical Museum has a new audience:
teachers who teach art. A re-branded brochure include important information about the
museum, including a map, while also capturing the attention of this audience.

#### Solution

The style of the branding is heavily inspired by the
geometric style of Swedish design. The blue and yellow in
the color palette is drawn from the Swedish flag. Because
the American Swedish Historical Museum’s goal is to allow
everyone to celebrate their cultural heritage, the branding
isn’t purely focused on Sweden. The additional red in the
color palette is drawn from other flags in Scandinavia,
specifically Iceland, Norway, and Denmark. Red, white,
and blue also represents the United States, half of the
identity of Swedish Americans. The mosaic style relates to
the coming together of multiple cultures in America and
Scandinavia. However, the color palette stays Sweden,
which is the only country to use yellow.

A gateway fold for the brochure shows the hospitality
of the Swedes. It emulates the experiences of entering
the museum, which has double doors that lead to the
gallery. The floor plan is in isometric view because, since
the location is small, this adds an extra excitement to the
interesting displays.

The illustrative style of the collateral with the bright colors
is also meant to appear child-friendly. With consideration
to the target audience, the design is straight-forward and
professional enough to work as a map, but fun enough to
add show teachers that the location has exciting art and
design that children will be intrigued by.
