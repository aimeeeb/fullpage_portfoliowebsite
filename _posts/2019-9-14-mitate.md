Mitate is a "create your own zen garden" idle mobile game. The goal of Mitate is to be used as a teaching tool. Ideally, the use of the app will cause users to better appreciate zen gardens in real life.

#### Name

The name Mitate comes from the Japanese word for the practice of using metaphors or imagination in garden design. This concept is represented in the app with the unique names for each object for the garden such as “hills” for a pile of rocks or “river” for a path of pebbles. Outside of the imaginative aspect of the objects, there are items that were historically used in zen gardens. The “boat” is based on a specific stone in the garden of the Daisen-in temple in Kyoto. The “mountain” comes from a mound of sand from Ginkaku-ji (Temple of the Silver Pavilion). This makes the app, despite being on a phone and in a simplistic illustration style, as authentic to traditional zen gardening as possible.

#### Design

In addition to the objects on the garden, there are also options to change the wall and the scenery. This is inspired from the concept of borrowed scenery in zen gardens, where the location and the background are important aspects of the design. In most designs, gardeners would use walls to cut off undesirable parts of a background and may choose pathways to ensure that the garden and the borrowed scenery are viewed from a certain angle. The app gives the user the power to do the same. In addition, the seasons and ideas of change are a significant part of gardening in China and Japan. The app prototype includes cherry blossoms, which occur in late spring, so the scenery would allow users to change their garden based on the seasons. 

The interactivity of having to constantly check into the app to remove leaves retains the idea that zen gardens are meant to be a tool for meditation and hardwork: two things valued in Zen Buddhism. The point of the app is not simply to make a pretty garden but also causes users to practice the discipline of constantly needing to upkeep their garden. Besides maintenance, “cleaning” the garden also allows users to experience a meditative moment each day where they can briefly forget about the temptations of the outside world and focus on one repetitive task.

 With the use of the unique names for the objects in the garden, users might create stories with the app despite the materials actually resembling rocks and gravel. This may help them to better experience the mitate created in real gardens, since they already have practice in creating personal stories from simple objects. It can also turn viewing zen gardens into a collaborative experience. Users are working with the same objects as famous garden designers and can see how their design thinking compares to those from historical artists. Lastly, the app should give a better appreciation to every aspect that goes into garden design. Because users have the power to choose their walls and scenery, when viewing a garden in the real world they may be more aware of how intentional everything is. Mitate hopes to capture the value, thought, and effort that is involved in zen gardens.
