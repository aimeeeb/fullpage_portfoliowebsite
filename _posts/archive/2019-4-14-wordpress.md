Wordpress is a service that allows people to create their own websites and blogs. It
offers free and paid services with a variety of themes, plugins, stats, and customization
options that allow anyone to create a site without technical knowledge. Many parts
of the interface are busy and unintuitive. They require a lot of steps that are not
immediately obvious to new users. In addition, the interface of the app could use a face
lift to match the more contemporary UI of popular apps like Twitter or Instagram.

#### Solution

The main goal of the redesign is to simplify the app. Many pages
that used to be separate are combined. For example, blog posts
can be viewed through the “Pages” section, instead of being
a separate page. Different parts of the My Site page also don’t
redirect to a new page. On the phone there is a consistent menu
on the top and on the tablet it stays on the left. Things like all
the parts of the “Edit Site” page are kept in an accordion instead
of being separate links. Both of these allow users to quickly
move to a different section without having to make extra clicks
on a “back” button.

The increased use of photos and icons give the app a more
contemporary look. Most popular social apps utilize photography
or video over text, such as Snapchat, Instagram, and TikTok.
Pages and blog posts are represented with images and on the
site page a view of the home page is used.

The design achieves its goals while still using familiar Wordpress
branding. The colors and icons are kept consistent from previous
designs to not startle old users, while attempting to attract a
new, younger audience.
