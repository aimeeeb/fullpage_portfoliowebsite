Every year, Chapman University design students create posters to commemorate the achievements of the university. One design is chosen to be handed out at the school’s President State of the University Address. It is a great way to celebrate the students, the campus, and the community.

#### challenge

The 2020 commemorative poster celebrates two of the new apartment buildings for student living, which had just been completed. These buildings allow students to live in a community with their peers, experiencing a greater sense of safety and collaboration. These buildings represent the growth of Chapman’s student population and the possibility for further growth to the campus.

#### solution

**layout.** The poster is simple and gives equal attention to both buildings.

**illustration.** The design features the structure of buildings created out of typography.
