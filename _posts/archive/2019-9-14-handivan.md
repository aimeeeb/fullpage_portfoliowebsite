The Handi-Van is a bus service run by the City & County of Honolulu for individuals who
cannot take the regular bus service, qualifying based on the Americans with Disabilities
Act. Currently, users call a number 1 to 3 days before their ride to make a reservation.
The Handi-Van services include reserving a ride via phone call, rider alerts through a
certain website, and a separate page for tracking your reserved ride. Each service is
separate, so this prototype imagines them brought together into one app.

#### Solution

The Handi-Van’s branding mainly reflect the design of the
vehicles so the main colors of the app are the two shades of
blue and the white seen on the van. For the same reason, wave
swashes appear in certain places, which adds a feeling of the
ocean surrounding Hawaii. In contrast, rider alerts are a bright
yellow, so users know if something will affect their commute.

The font selected for the app was chosen for the thickness
and glyphs that most closely matched the style of the logo.
Throughout the app the main style used is bold. Because the
audience of The Handi-Van qualify based on the ADA, this may
include sight-impaired users. The boldness, largeness of the text,
and high contrast of black text on a white background are used
to help with readability.

In consideration for the audience, the app is designed to be
accessible. The app opens on the Upcoming Rides page where
the user can navigate to Rider Alerts (by tapping on the alert
at the top), see their reservations, track a ride (by tapping on
the ride listing), and schedule a new ride. This should shorten
the amount of actions required to reach any goal. If any part
of this is unclear, “MENU” is clearly typed in the top left corner
to lead users to other pages that they may need. Every page is
intended to have no scrolling to avoid any information being
lost, punctuating with added weight at the bottom from a
button or a blue box. For scheduling a ride, many apps for buses
or ride sharing rely on payment via credit card, but currently The
Handi-Van only accepts cash. This option is kept in the app for
users who aren’t yet able to transition to a bank card.
