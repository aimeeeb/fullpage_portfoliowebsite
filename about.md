# About Aimee

I am a designer born and raised in Honolulu, HI. Currently, I am attending classes at Chapman University in Orange, California for two degrees: **BFA in Graphic Design** and **BS in Computer Information Systems**. I have loved art since I was a child but UI/UX design is where I truly found a way to express my passion for problem solving and my curiosity about technology.
